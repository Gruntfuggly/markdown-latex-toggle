# Markdown Latex Toggle

This is a stupid extension which uses regular expressions to toggle formatting between Markdown and LaTeX. The resulting LaTeX should be suitable for use in an  `\include` statement.

It provides the commands `Convert Markdown To LaTeX` and `Convert LaTeX to Markdown`. Swapping from one to the other and then back again should result in the same document.

It also works on selections.

Supported:

- Headings (# to #####)
- itemized lists

To Be Supported:

- images
- enumerated lists
- bold, italic, fixed-font
- code blocks
